#Infinite Links

This is an innocent project to test trolling search engines.
Every time you visit a page it will generate ten pages that you can visit, which generates another ten pages, and so on.
Inspired by [MDamien's infinity](https://github.com/MDamien/infinity)

[Demo](http://infinitelinks-tjiu.rhcloud.com)

Please use it carefully. I am not responsible if Google or other search engines deindex your domain from their search results.

To run just clone the project and execute:
  ```bash
  node app.js
  ```
